This app lets you submit a photo of food and returns the predicted food category. 🍕

The model was developed using the [Food-101 dataset](https://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/datasets_extra/food-101/) and TensorFlow 2.3.0.
    
This is a Manning [liveProject](https://liveproject.manning.com).

Notes:  
- Time to inference will vary by user as it is dependent on the hardware.
